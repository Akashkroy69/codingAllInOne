# Import the turtle module
import turtle #turtle is a built-in Python library that allows us to create graphics and drawings

# 1. turtle.forward(distance)
# Moves the turtle forward by the specified distance in the direction it's facing.
t = turtle.Turtle() # Create a turtle object

t.forward(200)  # Move forward by 100 units

#2. turtle.backward(distance)
# Moves the turtle backward by the specified distance.
t.backward(50)  # Move backward by 50 units

#3. turtle.right(angle)
#Turns the turtle right by the specified angle in degrees.
t.right(270)  # Turn right by 90 degrees

# turtle.left(angle)
# Turns the turtle left by the specified angle in degrees.
t.left(45)  # Turn left by 45 degrees

# turtle.penup()
# Lifts the pen, so the turtle can move without drawing.
t.penup()    # Lift the pen
t.forward(50)  # Move forward without drawing

# turtle.pendown()
# Puts the pen down, so the turtle can draw as it moves.
t.pendown()   # Put the pen down
t.forward(100)  # Move forward and draw a line

# turtle.color(color)
# Sets the color of the turtle and the pen.
t.color("red")  # Set the turtle and pen color to red
t.right(150)
t.forward(100)  # Move forward and draw a red line

# turtle.pensize(width)
# Sets the thickness of the lines drawn by the turtle.
t.pensize(3)    # Set the pen thickness to 3
t.forward(100)  # Move forward and draw a thick line
