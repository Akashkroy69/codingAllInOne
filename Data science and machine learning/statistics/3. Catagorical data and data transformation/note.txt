Categorical Data in Data Science

Categorical data represents variables that contain labels or categories instead of numerical values. This data is often used to classify information into distinct groups. It's a crucial type of data in data science, especially when working with machine learning models or descriptive statistics.
Examples of Categorical Data

    Gender: Male, Female, Other
    Color: Red, Green, Blue
    Animal Type: Dog, Cat, Bird
    Yes/No Responses: Yes, No
    Rating: Good, Average, Poor

Types of Categorical Data

    Nominal Data:
        Represents categories with no inherent order.
        Example: Colors of shirts (Red, Green, Blue).

    Ordinal Data:
        Represents categories with a meaningful order but without precise differences between categories.
        Example: Education levels (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s).
